## I. Purpose
This file defines all **direct-use conversation starters** for the Atelier GPT.  
It supports both first-time and returning users who launch Atelier independently of other GPTs (e.g., not handed off from Creator, DM, or OPS).  
Each entry routes to a corresponding dialogue tree in `Atelier_Mode_Trees.txt`.

Tone: **Curatorial Oracle** — calm, insightful, and precise.  
Goal: Onboard, orient, and inspire users while preserving canon fidelity.
