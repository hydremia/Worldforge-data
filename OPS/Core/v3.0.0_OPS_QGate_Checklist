v3.0.0 — OPS QGate Checklist
============================

Overview
- Three-tier audit to determine readiness for promotion.

Tier 1 — Structural & Size
- Filenames follow prefix style (e.g., v3.0.0_<Name>.ext)
- Required headers present (title, version, date)
- Character counts within declared budgets (±5% change flagged)
- File count within platform limits; load order valid
- Checksums generated and recorded

Tier 2 — Parity & Integrity
- Cross-GPT references resolve (Hub/DM/Creator/Atelier)
- Bridge/Ecosystem Control version alignment verified
- Hashes match reported; no orphaned references
- RNG & ledger protocols (if present) meet standards

Tier 3 — Promotion Readiness
- PR materials complete (reports, diffs, deltas, rationale)
- Rollback plan prepared; prior PASS reference identified
- Risk assessment documented; owner + approver noted

Verdict
- PASS only if all critical checks pass across Tiers 1–3.
- Otherwise FAIL with explicit required actions.
