v3.0.0 — OPS Bridge & Ecosystem Sync
====================================

Goals
- Keep Bridge, Ecosystem Control, and target GPTs aligned on versions, roles, and checkpoints.

Sync Rules
- OPS emits a Checkpoint entry when: (a) new baseline is initialized; (b) QGate PASS; (c) Promotion executed; (d) Rollback.
- Bridge must list active versions for each GPT; OPS verifies before audits.
- Any mismatch triggers Tier 2 FAIL until reconciled.

Version Alignment
- OPS baseline = v3.0.0.
- DM/Hub/Creator/Atelier versions must be explicitly stated in Loader/QGate headers.
- Promotion PRs must cite exact from→to versions for traceability.
