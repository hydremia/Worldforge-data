**Date:** 2025-11-01
**Bridge:** v3.0.0-Bridge
**Canon Version:** v3.0.0
**Maintainer GPTs:** Hub, DM, OPS, Creator, Atelier
**Repo Path:** /dev/logs/DM_Build_Log_v3.0.2.md

---

## Build Continuation

This entry continues the DM GPT development following **v3.0.1**, which finalized the Tier 0 Knowledge Pack and the new conversational starters.
**v3.0.2** completes the **Tier 1 Knowledge Pack**, adding core mechanical data and reusable phrasing modules essential for session continuity and tactical narration.

---

## Summary of Updates

**Tier 1 Objective:** Equip the DM GPT with lightweight mechanical and narrative scaffolding without embedding world-specific or campaign data.

### New Files (Tier 1)

| File                               | Description                                                     | Size Target | Status |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `v3.0.0_Rules_55e_CoreExtract.txt` | Compact 5.5e mechanics reference for adjudication and RNG logic | <20 KB      | ✅      |
| `v3.0.0_DM_StatusBlocks_Min.txt`   | Standard phrasing for HP, conditions, morale, and environment   | <15 KB      | ✅      |
| `v3.0.0_DM_Recap_Patterns.txt`     | Structured recap and transition phrasing for scene continuity   | <15 KB      | ✅      |

---

## Integration Notes

* All three Tier 1 files are **read-only support layers** for the DM GPT runtime — no canon authority.
* Each file is designed for **in-session use** only: they can be cited, paraphrased, or adapted dynamically, but not edited or persisted.
* They provide coverage for 90% of adjudication, pacing, and recap tasks without referencing external compendia.

| Ruleset Alignment         | ✅      | 5.5e confirmed (2024/2025 baseline).                   |
| Mechanical Scope          | ✅      | Covers checks, saves, actions, combat, and conditions. |
| RNG Integration           | ✅      | Works seamlessly with RNG Policy (Tier 0).             |
| Tone & Status Consistency | ✅      | Phrase library harmonizes with ToneProfiles.           |
| Narrative Continuity      | ✅      | Recap templates validated for cross-session linkage.   |

## Next Phase — Tier 2 (Upcoming)

### Target Files

1. `v3.0.0_DM_Skill_Action_Library.txt` — categorized skill and action phrases for improvisation.
2. `v3.0.0_DM_Dialogue_Banks.txt` — adaptable dialogue tone samples (ally, foe, neutral).
3. `v3.0.0_DM_Pacing_Control.txt` — scene tempo modifiers and branch logic guides.

### Integration Goals

* Connect recap/condition phrasing to dynamic tone selection.
* Enable contextual variation (Hybrid vs Mythic modes).
* Finalize audit handoff schema for OPS cross-validation.
