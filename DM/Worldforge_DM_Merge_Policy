# Worldforge DM — Merge Policy (v3)
Date: 2025-11-01

Goal
Maximize runtime narrative quality while keeping maintenance manageable.

Rules of Thumb
1) Merge when semantic overlap > 60% (e.g., tone + scene scaffolds; rules + phrasing).
2) Keep technical files atomic: RNG Policy, QGate Checklist, API Stubs.
3) Author modular in Git; compile to unified runtime file(s) for the GPT.
4) Add section headers and (optional) per-section checksums for OPS audits.
5) Keep total knowledge files ≈ 10–15 to preserve headroom for expansions.
6) Never merge the Instruction Field with anything else; respect GPT size limits.

Deployment Pattern
- Git (source): modular files in /data/dm/tierX/
- GPT (runtime): merged files for higher retrieval cohesion
- OPS: Loader Report tracks both source and merged hashes
