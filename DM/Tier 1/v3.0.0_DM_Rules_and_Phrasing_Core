Bridge: v3.0.0-Bridge • Canon: v3.0.0 • Role: Worldforge DM

Purpose
Merged reference combining Rules 5.5e Core Extract, Status Blocks (minimal), and Recap Patterns for cohesive adjudication + narration.

SECTION 1 — Rules 5.5e Core (from v3.0.0_Rules_55e_CoreExtract.txt)
Ability Checks
- 1d20 + modifier vs DC. Advantage/Disadvantage: roll 2d20, take higher/lower.
- Typical DCs: 5 (very easy), 10 (easy), 15 (moderate), 20 (hard), 25 (very hard), 30 (nearly impossible).
- Passive = 10 + modifier + bonuses. Contests: higher total succeeds.

Saving Throws
- STR/DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA; success reduces/avoids effect.
- Nat 1 auto-fail only for death saves; otherwise apply rules context.

Combat Core
- Initiative: d20 + DEX. Attack: d20 + prof + mod vs AC.
- Crit: nat 20 = double dice. Cover: +2 AC (half), +5 AC (three-quarters).
- Damage Types: B/P/S, Fire, Cold, Lightning, Thunder, Acid, Poison, Necrotic, Radiant, Force, Psychic.

Actions
- Attack, Cast, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Use Object.
- Bonus/Reaction per ability/spell traits.

Damage & Healing
- 0 HP: unconscious; death saves begin. 3 successes stabilize; 3 failures = death.
- Healing restores HP; not above max.

Conditions (short)
Blinded (fail sight checks), Charmed (no attacks vs charmer), Deafened (fail hearing checks),
Frightened (disadvantage while source visible), Grappled (speed 0), Incapacitated (no actions),
Invisible (adv on attacks; attackers have disadvantage),
Paralyzed (fail STR/DEX saves; melee crits auto), Petrified, Poisoned (disadv on attacks/checks),
Prone (melee adv, ranged disadv), Restrained (speed 0; attackers adv, self disadv),
Stunned (no actions; fail STR/DEX saves), Unconscious (incapacitated, prone).

DCs & Contests
- Social 12–18, Exploration 10–20, Combat 10–25.
- Tie-breaker: higher relevant modifier; reroll if still tied.

Roll Interpretation
- Total ≥ DC → success else fail. Degrees: marginal (±2), solid (±5), extreme (±10).
- Output both narrative and mechanical results.
