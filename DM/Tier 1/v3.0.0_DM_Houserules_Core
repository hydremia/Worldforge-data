v3.0.0_DM_Houserules_Core.txt
Bridge: v3.0.0-Bridge • Canon: v3.0.0 • Role: Worldforge DM

Purpose
Defines default table-level mechanical variances from D&D 5.5e core.
These are applied automatically unless declined at campaign setup.
Each can be toggled per campaign; confirmations stored in session_state.

Usage
- Activated automatically on first campaign initialization.
- DM announces: “I use a few standard table rules; you can confirm or decline any.”
- OPS logs confirmation choices per user/campaign.
- Integrates with Rules & Phrasing Core for mechanical resolution logic.

---

SECTION A — Default Rule Activation Logic
1) On new campaign start, list each rule by name and description.
2) Ask: “Do you wish to keep, modify, or disable this rule?”
3) Save results as:
   - ✅ Confirmed (active)
   - ⚙️ Modified (custom text)
   - ❌ Declined (inactive)
4) OPS persists results to `session_state → houserules_profile`.
5) Recap selected rules at each session start.

SECTION B — Core Houserules (Defaults)

🕐 Action Economy Exchange
Rule: A character may use an Action to perform any Bonus Action,
as long as they do not repeat something already used as a Bonus Action this round.
Rationale: Expands tactical flexibility without breaking economy balance.

🧴 Healing Potion Variance Healing
Rule:
- Consuming a healing potion as a Bonus Action → roll normally for HP recovered.
- Consuming as an Action → automatically heal the potion’s maximum HP value.
Rationale: Encourages tactical choice between time and reliability.
Integration: Hooks into RNG Policy (roll vs. max mode).

⚔️ Perkins Critical
Rule:
- When you score a Critical Hit, your bonus dice deal maximum damage instead of rolling.
- Example: “One die max crit.” (1d8 weapon = 8 + modifiers).
Rationale: Streamlines crit math and makes hits more cinematic.

💀 Recovery from Being Downed
Rule:
- When reduced below 0 HP and healed back to consciousness, gain 1 level of Exhaustion.
Rationale: Reflects near-death trauma and discourages repeated “yo-yo” healing loops.
Integration: OPS tracks Exhaustion levels; DM narrates symptoms.

🪂 Increased Falling Damage
Rule:
- If falling damage > Constitution score → knocked prone, must make CON save DC = half damage (min 10);
  on fail, speed halved until end of next turn.
- If falling damage > 2× Constitution score → immediately reduced to 0 HP.
Rationale: Adds physical realism and risk without complicating math.

🧩 Homebrew Inclusion Policy
Rule:
- Homebrew and third-party content allowed, subject to DM review for balance.
- Any content listed under Homebrew Approved in campaign capsule is automatically valid.
Rationale: Encourages creativity while maintaining world integrity.
Integration: OPS logs approvals in capsule_meta → homebrew_registry.

SECTION C — Session Confirmation Dialogue Pattern
DM: “I use a few default table rules—want me to go over them?”
Player: “Sure.”
DM: “Here’s the quick list.
• Action Economy Exchange — trade your Action for any Bonus Action (once per round).
• Healing Potions — Bonus = roll, Action = max.
• Criticals — max damage on extra dice.
• Recovery from 0 HP — gain 1 exhaustion.
• Falling — high falls hurt more, sometimes knock you out.
• Homebrew — open with approval.
Would you like to keep these defaults or change any before we start?”

SECTION D — OPS + QGate Notes
- Persistence: store results in session_state.houserules_profile.
- Audit: OPS confirms each active rule at session export.
- Validation:
  - Ensure no conflicts with 5.5e SRD.
  - Mark any modified text with revision ID.
- Future Hooks:
  - Variant Packs (Hardcore, Heroic, Cinematic) can override these defaults.
  - Each pack inherits and can selectively replace these rules.
