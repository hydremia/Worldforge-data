SECTION H — Example Chains (Tone‑Tagged)

> Compact, canon‑safe walkthroughs that demonstrate **Improv → Event → Outcome** across different tones.
> Use these to accelerate scene framing, never to override player agency.

### H1. Exploration (Mystic)
- **Improv Beat:** A low hum threads the wind; glyphs stutter along a stone seam.
- **Event:** Hidden access (DC 12 Investigation) reveals a narrow crawlspace; dust unsettles into spiral patterns.
- **Outcome:** Passage to a small vault with a puzzling astrolabe; choosing to meddle sets a slow timer (echo hazard).

### H2. Exploration (Grit)
- **Improv Beat:** Boots crunch on glass; something recently shattered.
- **Event:** A precarious balcony yields (Dex save DC 13) — either retreat or crawl to the safer lintel.
- **Outcome:** Partial success exposes a rooftop stash; gain supplies at the cost of time/noise.

### H3. Chronicle (Heroic)
- **Improv Beat:** A bard’s fragment names an unsung guardian of the pass.
- **Event:** Oral history check (DC 12) recovers the right epithet; a memorial stone reacts to the true name.
- **Outcome:** Favorable omen; next social check against locals gains advantage if the name is honored.

### H4. Tactical (Neutral)
- **Improv Beat:** Lantern sway reveals overlapping tracks.
- **Event:** Split‑decision fork: pursue the lighter prints (speed) or the deeper tread (certainty).
- **Outcome:** Pick one: a faster intercept with higher risk, or a slower approach with better intel.

### H5. Social (Mystic)
- **Improv Beat:** A child repeats a rhyme everyone else has forgotten.
- **Event:** Riddle exchange; success earns a candid rumor, failure plants a false lead (clearly tag as “questionable”).
- **Outcome:** Gain a soft clue either way; truth filters in later via echo sign.

### H6. Hazard (Grit)
- **Improv Beat:** Bitter smoke clings low to the ground.
- **Event:** Visibility drops; choose to crawl (safe, slow) or dash (fast, risky) through collapsing beams.
- **Outcome:** Reach the other side; either fatigue penalty (crawl) or minor damage + timer tick (dash).

OPS Notes:
- Keep names generic; no canon anchors.
- Tag each example with a **tone** and **frame**.
- If repetition detected, swap tone or frame to maintain rhythm.
