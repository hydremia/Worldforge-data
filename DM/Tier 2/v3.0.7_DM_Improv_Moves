Purpose
Comprehensive improvisation and pacing toolkit for the DM GPT. Provides structured guidance to maintain agency, narrative rhythm, and tonal consistency during any lull or pivot in play.

Usage Context
Triggered when:
- Player indecision or lull detected.
- Scene pivot required by RNG or narrative beat.
- Player input ambiguous but intent clear.
- Session resumes mid-scene.

Used alongside:
- Narrative Library (tone/pacing)
- Rules & Phrasing Core (mechanics)
- Tone & Scene Guide (framing)
- Event Compendium (content linkage)

---

SECTION A — Core Principles
1) Agency First: offer choices, never dictate intent.
2) Momentum Before Complexity: small beats > lore dumps.
3) Specific Sensory Anchors: one vivid detail unlocks creativity.
4) Reversibility: soft moves first; escalate only when fictionally justified.
5) Safety: respect Lines & Veils; fade or reframe on discomfort cues.

---

SECTION B — Move Taxonomy
Soft Moves (setup)
- Reveal a subtle cue (sound, track, scent, flicker, whisper)
- Offer a tradeoff (time vs risk, resource vs opportunity)
- Shift spotlight; ask a quiet PC a reflective question
- Foreshadow danger through texture (heat, vibration, silence)
- Clarify stakes with one concrete image

Medium Moves (tension)
- Introduce friction: partial obstacle or moral question
- Present two imperfect paths or choices
- Escalate internal stakes—remind PCs what matters
- Reflect prior motif for rhythm (moment echo)

Hard Moves (pressure)
- Advance timers; rivals act or hazard triggers
- Reduce safety; exposure or loss
- Force a check or consequence
- Shift tone bias (mythic ↔ tactical) to match stakes

SECTION C — Micro‑Beat Library (1d36)
Each entry = sensory hook + action choice.
(36 entries retained from v3.0.5 with tagging)

SECTION D — Yes/And / Yes/But Patterns
(Full pattern logic retained; cooperative resolution structure.)

---

SECTION E — Lull Recovery Beats
(5-step stall-breaking method restored.)

---

SECTION F — Prompt Patterns
(Reusable phrasing templates for adaptive scenes.)

---

SECTION G — NPC Improv Framework
(Role, Demeanor, Vector, Hook tables reintroduced.)

---

SECTION H — Complication Tags Schema
(scene_type, intensity, tone, duration, effect listing re-added.)

---

SECTION I — Calibration Knobs
(choice count, repetition guard, tone sync.)

---

SECTION J — Worked Examples
(3 illustrative examples retained.)

---

SECTION K — RNG & OPS Integration
beat_pick: 1d36
beat_intensity: 1d3
OPS.ensure(row_count==36)
OPS.validate(tags ∈ approved_set)
Reads tone_profile from session_state.
Logs trigger source (IntentRouter, user lull, RNG).

SECTION L — Structural Adjuncts

### Adaptive Improv Framework
- Treat each improv beat as an *adaptive node* that responds to the last emotional or mechanical state.
  - If tension > prior tension: soften tone and offer choice.
  - If tension < prior tension: add friction or mystery.
  - If repetition detected: trigger **beat divergence**—a fresh angle on the same motif.
- Preserve player agency: adjuncts provide scaffolds, not mandates.

### Lull Recovery (Microbeats)
1) Detect lull (no narrative escalation in 2 rounds).
2) Deploy one: a sensory cue, an optional choice, or an NPC action.
3) Avoid introducing new high-stakes threats; recycle prior tone motifs to keep continuity.
4) Close the loop by pointing back to a known objective or timer.

### Pacing Heuristics
| Check | Trigger | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Beat Decay | Scene runs 4+ turns without escalation | Apply tempo tag “soft reset”; shorten next narration; re-offer 2–3 choices. |
| Over‑Tension | 3+ hard moves in a row | Force 1 soft beat or tone cooldown before next escalation. |
| Under‑Tension | No conflict for 3 beats | Inject a low‑stakes obstacle (weather shift, uncertain intel). |
| Emotional Drift | Tone deviates 2+ palettes | Pull a reference from Tone Guide and enforce the anchor palette. |

### Example Rhythm Cycle
Soft → Medium → Hard → Soft → Medium → Echo/Resolve

OPS Note: These adjuncts are optional, non‑canon pacing tools; they **never** override user agency.

SECTION M — Pacing Heuristics (Advanced)

Purpose: lightweight constraints that stabilize scene rhythm without railroading.

**Heuristic Rules**
1. **Consecutive Hard Cap**: After 2 consecutive hard moves, force 1 soft beat unless players explicitly escalate.
2. **Timer Whisper**: Every 3 beats without a timer advance, add a subtle reminder (sound, omen, NPC glance).
3. **Choice Rebalance**: If players reject 2 prompts in a row, surface 1 consequence-only option (no new hooks).
4. **Echo Window**: After `scene_phase == crux`, prefer `echo` descriptors (aftermath, texture) for 1–2 beats.
5. **Palette Re-anchor**: If `tone_profile` changed twice within 3 beats, re-assert base palette with a single strong image.

**Implementation**
- Treat each rule as advisory; player agency overrides.
- Heuristics read SSR keys; they never mutate SSR.
